# Nutri-Score prediction for Travealth app

Travel from everywhere, eat like at home ! </br>
The objective of this project is to predict the nutri-score of the world's food products. </br>
This will allow the Travealth application to offer you equivalent products in terms of nutrition, regardless of the country in which you are located.</br>

This feasibility study was conducted using data from 
<a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">Open Food Fact</a>

## Feasibility study of the prediction
1 - Description and cleaning of the Open Food Fact dataset </br>
2 - Analysis of the variables relevant to our application </br>
3 - Determination of variables correlated to the Nutri-Score </br>
4 - Prediction of the missing Nutri-Score (K-Means) </br>
5 - Comparison of predicted vs. actual results </br>
